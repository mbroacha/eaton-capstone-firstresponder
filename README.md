# eaton-capstone-firstresponder
Framer prototype for a data visualization for disaster responders. This was created for a capstone project between Eaton and Carnegie Mellon University.

Note that the Material Design elements used in this prototype were borrowed from <a href="https://blog.framer.com/introducing-the-materialcomponents-module-for-framer-890d32f09b6d" Tess Gadd </a> with some corrections.
